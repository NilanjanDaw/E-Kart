Hey there!
We’ve been absent for a while. But we are back with some super news that we just had to share with you folks.
On November 28th, 2012, we launched Ekart eBooks with less than one lakh books and an Android app to enable reading on the go.
Time’s just flown and it’s already time for our first anniversary!
The response we have got from all of you has been nothing less than phenomenal. Today we have the widest selection of Indian titles in the market and have expanded our selection to more than half a million titles. And a million more titles are on their way!
We have also worked on making the reading experience better. This year saw the launch of eBook apps for iOS, Windows and a web reader for customers who prefer to read on the cloud.
Our apps are truly world-class and provide the coolest of features – they use our FlipStream technology to provide a faster and better reading experience to users.
You can switch the reading mode (day, night and sepia), font size and orientation (landscape/portrait), ability to highlight any text, take notes, bookmark pages and refer to a dictionary while reading.
That’s not all. We are also the first in the market to support regional languages properly in the digital format (check out our Hindi eBooks to experience this).
We also added an offline reading mode feature to our web reader today. Now you can download your eBooks to your PC/Mac, just like you do on an app and continue to read your eBooks uninterrupted – even if you are on a flight or train without access to the internet.
And now for the best news! To celebrate our anniversary, we are giving away more than one lakh books at Rs. 99 or lower for a limited period! It’s all here!
So hop on to the eBook bandwagon and celebrate with us – because we couldn’t have done it without you guys. Happy e-reading!
